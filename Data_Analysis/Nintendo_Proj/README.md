# Nintendo Games Sales Analysis

After purchasing a Nintendo Switch, I became interested in Nintendo game popularity. 
Consequently, I scraped Wiki tables and used SQL to first individually analyze sales for Nintendo's flagship products: Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Wii and Nintendo 3DS, leveraging Seaborn/Matplotlib to visualize KPIs like overall sales, sales by genre, sales by developer and sales by console. 
Finally, I used SQL joins to create a comprehensive database that compared Nintendo console sales to a Wikipedia listing of the bestselling games of all time.
